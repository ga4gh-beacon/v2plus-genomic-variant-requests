      ### Query for a deletion involving TP53
      
      #### Solution

      Query for a deletion involving TP53 using the maximum extent of the gene's
      coding region (known from somewhere...). The deletion to be found are expected
      to have an overlap with the queried range; however, the extent of the overlap
      is not pre-defined (most endpoints woul respond to a **recommended** "any"
      overlap but this is not a strict requirement imposed by the schema).
      Here positions refer to chromosome 17 on GRCh38 as indicated by the referenceName
      RefSeq ID.

      ### Query for a deletion involving TP53
      
      #### Solution

      Query for a deletion involving TP53 by using the HUGO name to specify the
      gene. This request does not provide coordinates so on the server side matching
      has to be performed from annotated variants or by retrieving the gene's
      coordinates and creating internally a type of range request.
    requestType: g_variant
    request:
      geneId: TP53
      variantType: DEL

  g_variant_insertion_01:
    description: >-
      ### Find events in TP53 or in close proximity (Â±~5000bp)
      
      #### Solution

      For this query the mapping position of TP53 (17:7669607-7676593) has to be
      known. Usually this knowledge would be provided by a front end helper and
      the aditional padding added manually or w/ a helper field (if frequent scenario)
      and the beacon itself would just receive the positional range request.

      The "insertion" type is here provided through the Sequence Ontology term
      `SO:0000667` and for the chromosome the full, prefixed RefSeq term is being used.
