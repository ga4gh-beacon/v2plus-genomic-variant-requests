      ## Find variants overlapping an approximate sequence location

      ### Solution `g_variant` with range indicated by single `start` and `end` positions (`BV2rangeRequest`)
      and `variantType`

      Here sequence variants at a specifiied region on chromosome 2 are matched
      by using single start and end positions to indicate the genomic *range*.

      CAVE: Since no variant type is indicated such a query can potentially
      match a large number of variants, depending on the beacon's content
      and query interpretation (e.g. "any" overlap of a CNV could be matched
      unless the variant type is required for CNV queries).
