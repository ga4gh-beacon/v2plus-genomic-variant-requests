# Variant queries (and representation) beyond Beacon v2 - **VQS**

Starting from the Beacon v2 `GenomicVariation` model this repository provides a develop and test environment for the Beacon Variant Scouts team, to generate an updated query and data model aligned with VRS v2.n.

The initial focus here is on the redesign of [Beacon variant request parameters](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/genomic_variation-v2.n-draft-model/blob/main/src/requests), explicitly including breaking changes.
