# Request Pattern: `BV2bracketRequest`

A typical Beacon v2 request for matching variations where start and end fall in a genomic range. Here, the approximate or varying positions for variation start and end are queried through brackets, _i.e._ by using 2 values for `start` and `end` each. This is a typical scenario in querying for CNVs where the `variantType` parameter indicates the relative change in genomic copy number through either VCF derived string parameters or, preferably, EFO terms (pls. refer to the class definition.)
